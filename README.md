The implementation and performance analysis of an Express.js HTTP server with middleware for capturing request-response timing. The server is built using Node.js and utilises Express.js framework for handling HTTP requests and responses. Middleware functions are employed to calculate the Round-Trip Time (RTT) for each request-response cycle. The project discusses the design, implementation details, and performance evaluation of the server, shedding light on its efficiency and effectiveness in serving web content.
